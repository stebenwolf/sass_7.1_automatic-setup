# sass_7.1_automatic-setup

### A batch file that automatically creates all the (empty) files and folders you need for your next SASS 7.1 project

Dear Windows users
This batch script creates all the necessary files and folders for your next SASS project 

Inspired by @abhagsain (https://gist.github.com/rveitch/84cea9650092119527bc#gistcomment-3040049)
And updated with SASS Guidelines : https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture


## How to use it ?

1. Open your favourite text editor
2. Copy/paste this code in it
3. Save the file with a .bat extension, e.g. sass_setup.bat
4. Paste the file at the base of your project and simply execute it.
5. It will automatically create a folder named "sass" with all the subfolders and (empty) files you need in it.
